## 📂 Repository Structure


- **data/**  
  - `Bank Customer Churn Prediction.csv` – cleaned customer dataset.  

- **notebooks/**  
  - `bankchurnAnalysis.ipynb` – EDA, churn calculations, trend visualizations.

- **plots/**  
  - Saved charts generated by the Streamlit app.

- **dashboard.py**  
  - Streamlit application to view interactive churn dashboards.

- **requirements.txt**  
  - Python dependencies for analysis & dashboard.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Quantify customer churn (≈20%)  
- Identify key drivers (zero balance, inactivity, age groups, region)  
- Visualize patterns via charts and dashboards  
- Provide stakeholders with easy‑to‑use interactive tools

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hpatel-30/Bank-Customer-Churn_Analysis.git
cd Bank-Churn-Customer-Analysis
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare Data
- Place Bank Customer Churn Prediction.csv in the data/ folder.

### 4. Run Jupyter Notebook (EDA)
```bash
jupyter notebook bankChurnAnalysis.ipynb
```

### 5. Launch Streamlit Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

- Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.
- Fill in your name & email to start exploring charts.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Data storage & querying: MySQL
- Analysis: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
- Web dashboard: Streamlit
- Spreadsheet dashboard: Google Sheets (pivot tables & slicers)
- Version control: Git & GitHub

 ## 📋 Key Learnings
